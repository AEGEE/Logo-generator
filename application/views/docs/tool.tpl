<h1>This Download Tool</h1>
<p>This Visual Repository and download tool was developed after the first Visual Identity Manual of AEGEE-Europe was adopted. The aim is to enable the AEGEEans to create the best materials in accordance with the visual identity and professionlise the communications of AEGEE.</p>
<p>A tool was developed to generate the AEGEE-Logo's on the fly. The tool takes into account the size of the name of the local, whether one wants a caption or not, etc. The algorithm to determine the font and its size works in the following way:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It checks if the maximum used font-size fits within the available space. If not it continues at each next step until the text fits.</li>
	<li>It reduces the font-size by maximum 10%.</li>
	<li>It tries to place the text over two lines in the best possible way with the original font-size.</li>
	<li>It reduces the font-size by maximum 15%.</li>
	<li>It tries to place the text over two lines and reduce the text by maximum 10%.</li>
	<li>It will reduce the letter-spacing by a few relative points.</li>
	<li>It will try another, more condensed, font and continues with this font at step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tool was first released in October 2013 and was developed by Maurits (AEGEE-Enschede) in cooperation with the Comit√© Directeur.</p>
